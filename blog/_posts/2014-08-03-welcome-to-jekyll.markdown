I found this little piece of Markdown in my `_posts` directory.
Basically to make a new blog post I make files following the following naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

And I can do code snippets! How cool is that!

How about some memoized recursion in ruby? Tasty! :) 

{% highlight ruby %}
@stat = [] def fact n n == 0 ? 1 : @stat[n] ||= n * fact(n-1) end
{% endhighlight %}

I will for sure be reading up on [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of this.
